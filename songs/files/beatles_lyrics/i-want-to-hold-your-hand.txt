I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand

Oh please say to me
you'll let me be your man
and please say to me

Now, let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide
I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I can't hide

When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
