If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I've got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
and keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
and keep you satisfied
Ooo, if there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
To you, just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
and keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
and keep you satisfied
Ooo, if there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
To you, to you, to you
