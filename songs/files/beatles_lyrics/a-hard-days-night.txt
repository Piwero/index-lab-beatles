It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
everything seems to be all right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight, tight
Yeah, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right, Oh!
So why on earth should I moan
'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be all right
when I'm home
feeling you holding me tight
all through the night
Yeah, it's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right
