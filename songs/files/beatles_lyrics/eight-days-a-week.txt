Ooo I need your love, babe
guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
just like I need you
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week
Love you every day, girl
always on my mind
One think I can say, girl
love you all the time
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, girl
Eight days a week
Eight days a week

Eight days a week

Ooo I need your love, babe

Hope you need my love babe
just like I need you
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week
Love you every day, girl
always on my mind
One think I can say girl
love you all the time
Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
I ain't got nothing but love, babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
